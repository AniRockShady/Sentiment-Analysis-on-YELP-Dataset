# Sentiment-Analysis-on-YELP-Dataset
DATA SOURCE: https://www.yelp.com/dataset <br><br>
Sentiment Analysis with the VADER scoring technique is used for this analysis. The predicted sentiments from the reviews are compared with the ratings to check the Mis-classified ratings and sentiments. <br>
Finally a wordcloud is graphed with the negative sentiments. Please note that the word cloud contains dominant recurrence of same word in different form (ex: Order - Ordered, say-said, go-went, etc.,). To mitigate this issue, Stemming could have been a better option and I am welcome to the changes as I am too lazy to write 2 lines and run for another 4 hours XD. <br> <br>
I am attaching the source for stemming if that interests: https://pythonprogramming.net/stemming-nltk-tutorial/ <br> <br>
GoodLuck!
